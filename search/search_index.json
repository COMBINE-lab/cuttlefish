For example, a tiling <code>0\\ u\\<sub>1\\</sub> ... u\\<sub>n\\</sub>&gt; corresponds to the edge and gap multi-set <code>{(u<sub>0</sub>, u<sub>1</sub>), (u<sub>1</sub> u<sub>2</sub>), ... , (u<sub>n-1</sub>, u<sub>n</sub>)}</code>.

The output also includes a path-tiling for each individual sequence in the input references, i.e. an ordered list of the maximal unitig ids that completely tile that sequence. Put differently, the GFA outputs describe a colored de Bruijn graph in the sense that the color information for each vertex (maximal unitig) is encoded in the <code>P</code> (GFA 1.0) or the <code>O</code> (GFA 2.0) entries (or the tilings in the <code>.cf_seq</code> file, in the reduced output).</p> <p>Throughout the manuscript (Cuttlefish 1), when we mention the colored de Bruijn graph, we refer to a specific definition of colors. While this definition is intuitive and natural when constructing the compacted colored de Bruijn graph from a set of reference genomes, it is not the case that the Cuttlefish algorithm allows arbitrary coloring of the k-mers in the de Bruijn graph. Specifically, in the definition adopted herein, the color set of a unitig is the subset of input references <code>s<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub>, s<sub>i<sub>2</sub></sub>, ..., s<sub>i<sub>l</sub></sub></code> in which the unitig appears. This color information is implicitly encoded in the path entries of the output GFA files (the <code>P</code> entries in GFA 1.0 and the <code>O</code> entries in GFA 2.0). As a result, all unitigs produced by Cuttlefish are ''monochromatic'' under this coloring definition, as a change to the color set internally to a unitig would imply either a branch (which would terminate the unitig) or the start or end of some reference string and a sentinel k-mer (which would also terminate the unitig). If one were constructing the compacted colored de Bruijn graph from raw sequencing reads or from highly-fractured assemblies, then one may wish to adopt a different notion of color, wherein color sets may vary across an individual unitig.</p>"},{"location":"#example-usage","title":"Example usage","text":"<p>We use k = 3, and 4 CPU threads, with a working directory named <code>temp</code> in the following examples.</p>"},{"location":"#using-cuttlefish-2","title":"Using Cuttlefish 2","text":"<ul> <li>From FASTQ files</li> </ul> <p>To construct the maximal unitigs of the example FASTQ file <code>reads.fq</code> (provided in the <code>data</code> directory) with frequency cutoff <code>c = 1</code>, the following may be used.</p> <pre><code>cuttlefish build -s reads.fq -k 3 -t 4 -o cdbg -w temp/ --read -c 1\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>From FASTA files</li> </ul> <p>To construct the maximal unitigs of the example FASTA file <code>refs1.fa</code> (provided in the <code>data</code> directory), the following may be used.</p> <pre><code>cuttlefish build -s refs1.fa -k 3 -t 4 -o cdbg -w temp/ --ref\n</code></pre> <p>These executions will produce two output files each: <code>cdbg.fa</code>, containing the maximal unitigs of the graph; and <code>cdbg.json</code>, a metadata file with some structural characteristics of the graph.</p> <p>Multiple seq-files, lists of seq-files, or directories of seq-files may also be passed, as described in Usage.</p>"},{"location":"#using-cuttlefish-1","title":"Using Cuttlefish 1","text":"<p>To output the compacted de Bruijn graph (in GFA 2.0) for the example FASTA files <code>refs1.fa</code> and <code>refs2.fa</code> (provided in the <code>data</code> directory), the following may be used:</p> <pre><code>cuttlefish build -s refs1.fa,refs2.fa -k 3 -t 4 -o cdbg.gfa2 -f 2 -w temp/\n</code></pre> <p>You may also provide lists or directories of reference files as input, as described in Usage.</p>"},{"location":"#larger-k-mer-sizes","title":"Larger k-mer sizes","text":"<p>The default maximum k-mer size supported with the installation from source is <code>63</code>.
